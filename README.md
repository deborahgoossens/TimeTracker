# TimeTracker

The TimeTracker is a tool for logging hours. This tool contains the possibility to register users, clients and projects. It's also possible to request an overview of the registered hours on a project or by user.

## Usage

Currently it's only possible to run the Java code in Netbeans or in your terminal as this tool contains solely functionalities without a front like a website or application.

In Netbeans hit F6 to run the code. In your terminal type `java -cp build/classes/timetracker/ TimeTracker` to execute.
